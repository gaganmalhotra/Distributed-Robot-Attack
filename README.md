# Distributed-Robot-Attack
A simulation project implemented in Java and Swings. Used TCP/IP &amp; Socket programming for communication between robots without central command using Ricart and Agrawala’s mutual exclusion algorithm. Implemented Byzantine general’s problem to make system fault tolerant in case of presence of malicious robots


Java, TCP/IP, Socket Programming · A simulation project where the robots need to find and surround target without any central command by using Ricart and Agrawala’s mutual exclusion algorithm. 
Implemented the Byzantine general’s problem to make the system fault tolerant in case of the presence of malicious robots.
